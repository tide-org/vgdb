[x] add option for stacking/abutting extra windows
[x] detect symbols in files
[x] add open buffers at startup option
[x] find empty buffer for loading source code
[x] split window handling into separate autoload vim file
[x] add disassembly output buffer ( add to empty buffer or abutt)
[n] abstract the four types of buffer - default register, streaming/log, debug window, breakpoint
    could be conidered as:
      refreshed/iterated     - register or memory and comparison before/after
      appended/continued     - session log
      controlled/structured  - disassembly or other where output is modified
      used/derrived          - breakpoint where output is used for another window or status buffer
    useful for config

[x] replace poyo with pyyaml
[x] make command steps an array of steps
[x] add nose tests for python components
[x] make all config_dicts call Config()
[x] implement 2-way event-driven vim to python variables - py to vim working - to implement reverse as required
[x] make plugins directory moveable
[x] allow defaults for config variables
[x] make startup command be done from config
[x] move target remote to config
[x] move check_set_remote to config file
[x] create functions to trigger all events for different areas - before/after command, buffer updates, spawn and config commands - done for most, needs documenting
[x] refactor run_to_entrypoint into config.yml
[x] make 'config_command' step
[x] make create_string step
[x] make 'run_command_string' step
[x] make 'run_command' step

[x] refactor vg_config_buffers to use dict
[x] refactor vg_display code for disassemble into separate file/class
[x] refactor diff code to separate vg_diff.vim
[x] investigate buffer_name stuff in vgdb.py - why is it used? - can now use for an initial buffer or force to buffer
[n] move disassembly.vim into plugins or python where possible - not doing (for now)
[x] refactor Vgdis into config file
[n] make calls to run config command call back to vim to give option to update buffers as well (or call update_buffers from python) - not required as is run after last config command anyway

[x] refactor step, break, run, etc. to be generic and in config template
[x] create command plugin architecture - e.g. run to entrypoint, command events - eg stepi
