[x] add session log file
[x] start at entrypoint option
[x] integrate docker debugging
[x] add register view buffer and update with step
[x] add source for os-specific test binaries
[x] establish if symbols file found from starup
[x] fix session log when run command run multiple times in one call - eg Vgrte
[x] add a session log view buffer and update with step
[x] add vim startup variables - start and connect, start and run to entrypoint (must specify binary)
[x] add option to run command before startup of vgdb - eg. docker container with gdbserver
[x] make buffers non-modifiable by user
[x] format disassembly output for debug and match step output to current line (with highlight)
[x] add highlight for changed register values between operations
[x] do various buffer/display.vim refactoring
[x] start Vgdis at current breakpoint if loaded - from entrypoint
[x] fix Vgdis opening in side window when no empty buffer (should stack in main window)
[x] refactor py vgdb into separate classes
[x] get list of breakpoints
[x] add piets for breakpoints in gutter (as per http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/sign.html)
[x] make breakpoints show in vg_disassembly without vg_breakpoints open
[x] add Vgcont to continue
[x] use register to write to buffer instead of append() (like NerdTree)
[x] add tests using [vimrunner](https://github.com/AndrewRadev/vimrunner) and add to as required
[x] add breakpoints view buffer and update with step
[x] add fix for macos using Vgrte: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40110435/unknown-ending-signal-when-using-debugger-gdb - done - https://stackoverflow.com/a/52450255/512965
[x] add option for stacking/abutting extra windows
[x] detect symbols in files
[x] add open buffers at startup option
[x] find empty buffer for loading source code
[x] split window handling into separate autoload vim file
[x] add disassembly output buffer ( add to empty buffer or abutt)
[n] abstract the four types of buffer - default register, streaming/log, debug window, breakpoint
    could be conidered as:
      refreshed/iterated     - register or memory and comparison before/after
      appended/continued     - session log
      controlled/structured  - disassembly or other where output is modified
      used/derrived          - breakpoint where output is used for another window or status buffer
    useful for config
