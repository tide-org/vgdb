[x] harden all config file yaml input to prevent errors on missing values - done with defaults yaml file
[x] make plugin paths work regardless of which path vim was started from

[x] get working with higher level C code
[x] add ability to scan for all source files for a binary
[x] add debugging source functionality and open the source files if present (start with .s files)

[n] add ability to list all source files as tabs or using NerdTree
[n] add gdb error/warning buffer view and update with step

[n] have ability to have end_of_output_regex on a per-command level (would overwrite default) - e.g. for ssh login etc. - not yet, no required use case atm
[x] create more tests - vader and nose - later
[x] add a variable logging framework with verbosity and area options - sort of done
[n] fix vg_registers in docker container - need to split on "\n", not \r but join lines and remove start and end ~ quotations - seems to be ok
[n] add the ability to patch up disassemblies to a single buffer when switching to range - maybe sort list as well - not now - more useful to do languages support atm
[n] use async functions for events (if necessary) - not doing - would warp reality as i know it
[x] add option to show line numbers for a buffer
[n] add option for buffer to be a filename and editable (but only when not debugging) - won't do yet - would be a bit messy
[n] create tests for config_command buffers, actions and events - not doing now - todo once py code is in separate repo
[x] cleanup plugin/commands.vim
[x] add piets to C test
[x] add ability to display file in vg_code buffer
[x] fix up C example config - piet breakpoints, local variables buffer

[n] add window affinity for buffer breaks - e.g. top. bottom, left, right, top-left, etc. - nah, maybe later
[x] fix buffer creating in new window when stepping through filename buffer. (e.g. start - bp - run - switch window - step - duplicate windows)
[x] create an option to allow buffers to be created from templates using jinja2 - e.g. a status window for C debugging.
[x] allow plugins from more than one path location - eg - base, plugins(common), plugins(specific) - sort of like Magento - for actions, config, filters, editor_wrappers, etc.
  - start at texpect path - specified path - additional paths specified in config - then plugin paths in config
  - should make a path priority list then iterate each one and grab config, actions, functions, etc.
  - do for: action.py, [functions, templates], editor_wrappers, filters, config.
  - use a config setting to call back to a previous config and build up a chain. e.g. settings.plugins.pre_load_config - could point to a base set of config and files to load first.
[x] figure out why test_c/filters/vg_base.py is still required after config chaining.
[n] (todo later) use arrays of files for filters, actions, functions, etc. to prevent lots of disk reads every time a command is run
[x] allow specifying actions from a config plugins path - done - not tested
[x] fix tests - add caching to all plugins
[l] add shell script function support (sort of like Ansible) args as a list on command line. Redirect stdout/stderr back as result. - maybe later
[x] fix freezing on vgdb -> set breakpoint -> step -> step - done - deleted swap file ./tests/binaries/c_test/.helper.c.swp
[x] make highlight line disappear when no longer debugging (no backtrace)
[m] figure out why freezing on vgruncommand run sometimes - monitor
 - steps: Vgdb -> set_breakpoint 6 -> run (freezes)

 -  also backtrace can return current filename and current line number. maybe later
[x] get a golang app working from source and binary
[x] fix logging error when all classes selected for debugging
[x] make an easy way of tracking/logging config actions
[n] make run_vim_command use input_args instead of event_input_args (as per run_python_command) - delineate the difference and settle on one (or document both and why) - not needed
[x] add the abillity to scroll buffer to keep current breakpoint/highlight line visible - use vim :g - follow breakpoint option
[n] allow list_breakpoints command to be run before disassembly in config - currently displays depending on order - requires investigating buffer cache order and precedence - not sure - too long ago
[n] add the option of adding a name: key to commands (like ansible) - yeah, nah
[x] componentise python config to allow use on multiple editors - texpect (or expectoids) - as a pip package that installs all dependencies
[l] dig into some of these freezing errors - likely from leaving processes in zombie state after exit - later
[x] refactor any editor commands in actions (e.g. get_buffer) back to editor_wrapper for portability
[m] standardise all editor-specific calls from python to use the editor_wrapper (e.g. actions/set_buffer) - maybe later
[n] add other process support (e.g. ssh, terminals, log streams, etc) - too vague
