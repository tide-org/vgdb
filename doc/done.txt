[n] abstract the four types of buffer - default register, streaming/log, debug window, breakpoint
    could be conidered as:
      refreshed/iterated     - register or memory and comparison before/after
      appended/continued     - session log
      controlled/structured  - disassembly or other where output is modified
      used/derrived          - breakpoint where output is used for another window or status buffer

[x] refactor Vgdis into config file
[n] make calls to run config command call back to vim to give option to update buffers as well (or call update_buffers from python) - not required as is run after last config command anyway

[x] create command plugin architecture - e.g. run to entrypoint, command events - eg stepi

[x] create actions pluggable and have built-in actions as well as functions plugins path
[x] implement error condition handling from output stream
[x] handle case where disassemble does not know the end address of a section of assembly - 'No function contains program counter for selected frame.' - see (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8201025/no-function-contains-program-counter-for-selected-frame/16629694) - sort of done - could be better though

[n] create a circular file/path visulalisation graph showing commit changes over time and descriptions (not doing as part of this)
[n] add option to only update registers and memory buffers when relevant commands have been run (step, stepi, continue, run, etc.) - not needed - over optimisation (see Knuth)
[n] optimise calls to get breakpoints only when required (adding/removing) - same
[n] move scroll to plugins/functions path - not doing as is a part of vg_session_log
[n] speed up diff, breakpoints and piets (currently very slow) - to do later
