[ ] fix up C example config - piet breakpoints, local variables buffer
[ ] add local variables buffer to C test
[ ] add abillity to set breakpoints in multiple files - add breakpoint from filename
[ ] create an option to allow buffers to be created from templates using jinja2 - e.g. a status window for C debugging.
[ ] allow plugins from more than one path location - eg - base, plugins(common), plugins(specific) - sort of like Magento - for actions, config, filters, editor_wrappers, etc.
[ ] make run_vim_command use input_args instead of event_input_args (as per run_python_command) - delineate the difference and settle on one (or document both and why)
[ ] add the option of adding a name: key to commands (like ansible)
[ ] implement multiple variable matches per command - eg backtrace - gives number but want a variable for error condition
[ ] componentise python config to allow use on multiple editors - texpect - as a pip package that installs all dependencies
[ ] add language support for python
[ ] allow specifying actions from a config plugins path
[ ] add the abillity to scroll buffer to keep current breakpoint/highlight line visible - use vim :g - follow breakpoint option
[ ] add ability to set a breakpoint/piet from the current line of code/disassembly
[ ] add shortcut keys for debugging - to vimrc and document as an example
[ ] add a timer refresh config option - useful for streaming logs and sampling - would call a command on a timer - e.g. every 5 seconds (like watch)
[ ] standardise all editor-specific calls from python to use the editor_wrapper (e.g. actions/set_buffer)
[ ] allow list_breakpoints command to be run before disassembly in config - currently displays depending on order - requires investigating buffer cache order and precedence
[ ] implement command on startup log file (use pexpect)
[ ] make stacking/abutting buffer-specific
[ ] add window affinity for buffer breaks - e.g. top. bottom, left, right, top-left, etc.
[ ] add max windows per column - e.g. 4 windows down before starting a new column of buffers - (or add a buffer grouping field to the config with settings)
[ ] add llvm support
[ ] add other process support (e.g. ssh, terminals, log streams, etc)
[ ] allow different configs to be called from vim command line
[ ] test on linux
[ ] update/create readme.md file
[ ] create a product website
[ ] promote it as an app
