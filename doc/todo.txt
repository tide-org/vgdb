[ ] get a basic c hello world app debugging correctly
[ ] test and add better support for local binaries (not remote)
[ ] get working with higher level C code
[ ] add ability to scan for all source files for a binary
[ ] make plugin paths work regardless of which path vim was started from
[ ] allow plugins from different languages - e.g. ruby, C, elixir, scala, .net, etc.
[ ] fix failing tests
[ ] have ability to have end_of_output_regex on a per-command level (would overwrite default)
[ ] allow specifying actions from a config plugins path
[ ] add ability to list all source files as tabs or using NerdTree
[ ] add debugging source functionality and open the source files if present (start with .s files)
[ ] fix vg_registers in docker container - need to split on "\n", not \r but join lines and remove start and end ~ quotations
[ ] create tests for config_command buffers, actions and events
[ ] add the abillity to scroll buffer to keep current breakpoint/highlight line visible - use vim :g - follow breakpoint option
[ ] add ability to set a breakpoint/piet from the current line of code/disassembly
[ ] add shortcut keys for debugging - to config
[ ] add a timer refresh config option - useful for streaming logs and sampling
[ ] use async functions for events (if necessary)
[ ] harden all config file yaml input to prevent errors on missing values
[ ] add the ability to patch up disassemblies to a single buffer when switching to range - maybe sort list as well
[ ] allow list_breakpoints command to be run before disassembly in config - currently displays depending on order - requires investigating buffer cache order and precedence
[ ] add the option of adding a name: key to commands (like ansible)
[ ] add editable variables/settings screen buffer
[ ] add edit register values functionality - do from run_command first (as in VgEdit register eax 0x00000034)
[ ] implement command on startup log file (use pexpect)
[ ] add update_on_commands list for buffers - buffers that are updated when specific commands are run (saves updating every time there is a command)
[ ] add gdb error/warning buffer view and update with step
[ ] make stacking/abutting buffer-specific
[ ] add window affinity for buffer breaks - e.g. top. bottom, left, right, top-left, etc.
[ ] add max windows per column - e.g. 4 windows down before starting a new column of buffers - (or add a buffer grouping field to the config with settings)
[ ] add edit memory values functionality
[ ] add edit variable values functionality
[ ] add gdb supported higher level languages support
[ ] add goto definition functionality
[ ] add interpreted languages support where possible
[ ] add llvm support
[ ] add other process support (e.g. ssh, terminals, log streams, etc)
[ ] allow different configs to be called from vim terminal
[ ] componentise python config to allow use on multiple editors
[ ] create a product website
[ ] promote it as an app
