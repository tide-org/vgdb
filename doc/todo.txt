[ ] make a runnable vimrunner test for registers window
[ ] create a vgdb variables builtin buffer

[ ] create a deterministic actions mapping feature (e.g. tree view or DOT graph)
[ ] make buffers only update when set in config with 'update_buffers'
[ ] wire up all the config yaml functions
[ ] document event steps: before_spawn, after_spawn, before_command, after_command, before_config_command, after_config_command, before_buffer_update, after_buffer_update
[ ] document all step types
[ ] create schematics of modules of app and workflows
[ ] handle case where disassemble does not know the end address of a section of assembly - 'No function contains program counter for selected frame.' - see (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8201025/no-function-contains-program-counter-for-selected-frame/16629694)
[ ] get pyyaml working correctly from autoload/lib path
[ ] step into disassembly code properly (when there are calls) and open new tabs as new disassembly is added. To use x/i $rip (as per https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1902901/show-current-assembly-instruction-in-gdb)
[ ] optimise calls to get breakpoints only when required (adding/removing)
[ ] implement command on startup log file (use pexpect)
[ ] create command for graceful shutdown of vgdb
[ ] add ability to set a breakpoint from the current line of code/disassembly
[ ] determine best tty setting by testing (or fix not to catch exception on complete stream)
[ ] refresh breakpoints between steps on vg_disassembly
[ ] create a 'when' config option for running extra commands conditionally
[ ] add option to only update registers and memory buffers when relevant commands have been run (step, stepi, continue, run, etc.)
[ ] add gdb error/warning buffer view and update with step
[ ] add local variables view buffer and update with step
[ ] add memory view buffers and update with step (requires variables for number, format, variable/register, etc.)
[ ] make stacking/abutting buffer-specific
[ ] add max windows per column - e.g. 4 windows down before starting a new column of buffers
[ ] add ability to scan for all source files for a binary
[ ] add ability to list all source files as tabs or using NerdTree
[ ] add editable settings screen buffer
[ ] add highlight for changed memory values between operations
[ ] use vim event loop for `BufUnload` when closing `vg_` buffers to prevent using bwipeout when fetching data (https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-vim-script-5/index.html)
[ ] add a status view buffer and update with step (to show os, bitness, target, target status, entrypoint addressi, current address)
[ ] add segments view buffer ( no update with step)
[ ] add sections view buffer ( no update with step)
[ ] add call stack view buffer and update with step (only if symbols loaded)
[ ] add thread view buffer and update with step
[ ] add debugging source functionality and open source files if present (start with .s files)
[ ] add shortcut keys for debugging
[ ] add edit register values functionality
[ ] add edit memory values functionality

[ ] add interpreted languages support where possible
[ ] add scripting plugin support
[ ] add llvm support
[ ] add other process support (e.g. ssh, terminals, log streams, etc)
[ ] add xserver to docker-compose containers to make tests self-contained
