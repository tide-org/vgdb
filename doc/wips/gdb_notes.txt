for debugging c applications that were built on mac as a MachO binary:

brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timotheecour/homebrew-timutil/master/gdb_tim.rb

as gdb needs to be codesigned (for local work) you should run vim as sudo with environment variables:

e.g.

sudo -E vim

for debugging a remote linux target:

brew install gdb --with-all-targets
