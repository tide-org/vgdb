There are various built-in actions that can be used to do useful things with vgdb in commands.

The built-in actions consist of:

- create_interpolated_string

    Description:
    Fields:
    Example:

- print_debug
- run_command
- run_command_string
- run_command_with_match
- run_config_command
- run_python_function
- run_vim_funcion
- set_var


These are built-in by virtue of the fact that they are in vgdb under the ./actions path. Custom actions can also be created and specified in your config file.
